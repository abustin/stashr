A service for stashing files in the cloud.  A quick way to move files between machines.

Alpha stage. The server only accepts a single key as of right now.  Next step is to create a key generator on the server.  Server code is not on github (yet).

==Setting account key==

stashr key <key>

==Stash current dir==

stashr put <stashname>
stashr get <stashname>
